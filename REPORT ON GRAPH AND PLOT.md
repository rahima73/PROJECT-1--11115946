## Bar Chart of Wine Quality against Fixed Acidity



![Graph of wine quality against fixed acidity](<graph 1-1.jpg>) 


The bar chart above presents a comparison of alcohol quality and fixed acidity based. Here are key observations:


1. **Fixed Acidity:**
   - Fixed acidity levels appear to vary across different quality ratings.
   - Wines with lower quality ratings (e.g., 5 and 8) show a tendency towards higher fixed acidity, while higher-quality wines may exhibit a broader range of fixed acidity levels.

2. **Relationship with Wine Quality:**
   - Analyzing the results, between alcohol content, fixed acidity, and wine quality reveals potential patterns. The lower the alcohol quality, the more likely it's fixed acidity is higher and the lower it's content. Likewise, the higher the alcohol quality, the lower it's fixed acidity and the higher it's content.

In summary, the bar chart provides a visual representation of how alcohol content and fixed acidity relate to wine quality. 



## Scatter Plot of  Alcohol against Residual Sugar

The scatter plot above visualizes the relationship between alcohol content and residual sugar in red wines. Key observations from the scatter plot are as follows:

1. **Diverse Distribution:**
   - The scatter plot reveals a diverse distribution of data points, indicating that the dataset includes red wines with a wide range of alcohol content and residual sugar levels.

2. **Lack of Clear Correlation:**
   - Upon visual inspection, there doesn't appear to be a clear linear correlation between alcohol content and residual sugar. Wines with varying levels of residual sugar can be found across the entire spectrum of alcohol content.

3. **Potential Nonlinear Relationships:**
   - The lack of a clear linear trend hints at the possibility of nonlinear relationships between alcohol content and residual sugar.

In conclusion, the scatter plot provides a comprehensive view of the distribution and relationship between alcohol content and residual sugar in red wines. The absence of a straightforward correlation suggests the presence of various factors influencing these attributes, warranting further investigation.
