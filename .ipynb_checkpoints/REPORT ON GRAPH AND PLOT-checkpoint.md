## Bar Chart of Wine Quality against Fixed Acidity



![Graph of wine quality against fixed acidity](<graph 1-1.jpg>) 


The bar chart above presents a comparison of alcohol quality and fixed acidity based. Here are key observations:


1. **Fixed Acidity:**
   - Fixed acidity levels appear to vary across different quality ratings.
   - Wines with lower quality ratings (e.g., 5 and 8) show a tendency towards higher fixed acidity, while higher-quality wines may exhibit a broader range of fixed acidity levels.

2. **Relationship with Wine Quality:**
   - Analyzing the results, between alcohol content, fixed acidity, and wine quality reveals potential patterns. The lower the alcohol quality, the more likely it's fixed acidity is higher and the lower it's content. Likewise, the higher the alcohol quality, the lower it's fixed acidity and the higher it's content.

In summary, the bar chart provides a visual representation of how alcohol content and fixed acidity relate to wine quality.
